# Assembly-language-8086-game
A brick shooting game written in assembly language x86.
Ran and tested on DOSBox.

## GAME MECHANISM:

The player has to shoot down bricks which appear on top of the screen, in order to win the player has to keep on shooting down bricks until the top most white colored bar gets filled. There are total of 6 bricks but everytime all the 6 bricks get taken down, the screen is renewed with 6 bricks again.

The player loses if he/she misses 3 shots.

The goal is to present this simple concept using assembly language x86 to familiarize oneself with the language and be able to code in it.
